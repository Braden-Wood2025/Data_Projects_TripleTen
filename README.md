# Data_Projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [Income and Expenses Workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y9H4be2GFuaeRC0ImJloQGkBes0Df3BWYxEPSysCnrQ/edit?usp=sharing) | This project  Summarizes the monthly financial performance for a business in the sixth month of operation. It served to offer insights into business practices to decide which expenses need to be lowered. |
| 2 | [Profit Analysis Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/First_Dashboard_Complete_17517514472520/ProfitByState?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) | This project provides an in-depth look into a companyâ€™s practices and reveals correlations between top-selling products and the regions where they perform best.|
| 3 | [Storytelling Project](https://public.tableau.com/shared/88N3PRC5F?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) | Identifies customers with highest return rates and what items they are returning so that decision makers can determine who to contact and in what way to discourage such behaviors and, in turn, hold onto the revenue generated from these sales. |
| 4 | Machine Learning Customer Interaction Strategies | The project task was to help a chain of fitness clubs develop a customer retention strategy. |
